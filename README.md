# OpenCV Basics Series

The "OpenCV Basics" project series offers a concise yet comprehensive guide to the foundational aspects of computer vision using OpenCV. Starting with basic image handling techniques like loading, displaying, and manipulating pixels, the series quickly moves into more complex tasks such as drawing, and performing geometric transformations including translation, rotation, and resizing.

The tutorials also cover image processing operations like flipping, cropping, arithmetic operations, bitwise manipulations, and masking, culminating in the advanced skill of channel splitting and merging. Each tutorial is paired with downloadable source code, making the learning experience both theoretical and hands-on, ideal for beginners aiming to swiftly master OpenCVâ€™s core functions.
